                    The Every Girl aligns their elements hortizoltally and vertically. This makes it easy to navigate and guided the eyes through the page because they next element is on the right nor is bellow. This helps

                <h3>Visual Hiearchy</h3>
                <h4>Apple</h4>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>
                <img>
                <p>
                    Apple shows visual hiearchy by making the iPhone name the biggest, so it is the first thing you see. They did this because the iPhone name is what you are first looking for. There is also a call to action that is different from the other text because it is blue.

                <h4>Sarahs Day</h4>

                <p>
                    Sarahs Day uses Hick's Law by having few options. There is only a menu, shopping cart, or scroll down. There is also not a lot of words, and makes me want to explore the page and use it.
